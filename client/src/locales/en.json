      "We will be with you in all stages of work, all property visits, until the finalization of the purchase and official administrative procedures, at no extra cost. Furthermore, if you buy a property from us, your stay during the visit will also be free.",
      "The first step is to visit our office. Just stop by our office during one of your trips to Istanbul. The next step is to visit houses, apartments, or villas with a price of over $400,000. (Of course, there is no need to purchase just one property; you can buy several properties with a total value of $400,000.) If you choose a house, you must register with the tax office, obtain a tax number, and open a bank account. After purchasing the house, by registering the deed, you can obtain a short-term residence permit in Turkey and apply for Turkish citizenship or a Turkish passport. You can receive your passport within a maximum of 6 months. However, in most cases, this process takes much less than 6 months."
